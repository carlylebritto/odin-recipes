    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Butter Chicken, also known as chicken makhani or traditionally as murgh makhani, is an Indian curry made with a base of a spiced tomato gravy with plenty of butter (makhan) and marinated chicken that's typically cooked in a tandoor. 
        It's famous for its bold red-orange color, silky smooth creamy texture, and rich flavors.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <h3>Overnight Marinade</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large ziploc bag the night before cooking add the yogurt, lemon juice, cumin, cinnamon, cayenne, black pepper, ginger, salt and chicken and mix well.</li>
        <li>If you don't want to marinade overnight, you can either marinade for 15 minutes or simply add the lemon juice and half the spices to your sauce (when you add in the cumin). Skip the yogurt.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Butter Chicken Sauce</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the butter, garlic and jalape√±o to a large skillet on medium heat until you can smell the garlic, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add the 2 teaspoons cumin, 2 teaspoons paprika, 1 teaspoon salt and cook for 1 minute, stirring constantly until the spices darken in color.</li>
        <li>Add in the tomato sauce and heavy cream, stir and cook for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Remove the sauce from your pan and keep to the side then wipe skillet clean.</li>
        <li>Add in 2 tablespoons of butter and vegetable oil to your large skillet on medium high heat.</li>
        <li>Remove most of the marinade (and discard this marinade) from your chicken and add it to the skillet (you can keep the chicken whole or cut into large chunks).</li>
        <li>Cook for 5-6 minutes on each side until cooked through.</li>
        <li>Top with sauce and bring to a simmer, then top with cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
